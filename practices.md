# Programming Practices

For each of the empty headings below, fill in the detail.

## Software Quality

Software quality is not the measure of _what_ the program does, rather, it is the measure of _how well_ it does it. Indeed, it's important to consider _how well_ at every stage.

### Maintainability

### Dependability

### Efficiency

### Usability

## Planning

Planning is the thing you should do both _before_ you start building your application, and while you're doing it. In general, some thought _beforehand_ will lead to much better outcomes both _during_ and _after_.

## Coding Standards

This section asks you to consider establishing consistent programming standards before you begin programming; hence, this is a bit like _planning_, too. In summary:

1. Know what the code must do
2. Maintain uniform naming (and layout) conventions throughout
3. Comment where necessary
4. Keep your code simple
5. Design your code! When building your apps, consider things like scalability and reuse

### Commenting and Documentation

## Development

This section is all about the good habits we establish _while_ writing code - it's important to have some processes in place.

### Testing

...

### Do One Thing (Single Responsibility)

...

### Debugging

...

### Refactoring
